# GBCNet
This is the official repository for the paper titled "Surpassing the Human Accuracy: Detecting Gallbladder Cancer from USG Images with Curriculum Learning" ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11433](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11433)). This paper proposed GBCNet, a specialized CNN model, for classifying gallbladder cancer (GBC) from ultrasound images. GBCNet introduces a novel "multi-scale second-order pooling" block for rich feature encoding from ultrasound images. The paper further proposed a novel visual acuity-based curriculum to train GBCNet. The proposed model beats SOTA deep CNN-based classifiers and human radiologists in classifying GBC from ultrasound images. 

### Installations
We will update the repository soon with the requirements file for the library installations.
